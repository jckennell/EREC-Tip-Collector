EREC Tip Collector ðŸ¥•

## Description 
This is a simple deflector shroud and catch tray for filament tips cut off by the Enraged Rabbit Encoder Cutter. Instead of flinging cut filament tips all over the place, the tip, when cut off, will hit the shroud and deflect into the tray below. This mod is if your ERCF is horizontally mounted.

## BOM
2X m2 x 6 screws
2X m2 heat set inserts


## Assembly
You can print the screw mounted version, which will require printing the servo mount with holes for m2 heatset inserts and screw the shoud to the servo mount with two m2 x 6 screws. Or just print the tape mounted shroud and attach it to the servo mount with double sided tape.
